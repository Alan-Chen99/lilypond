WINDOWS - compiling and installing GNU LilyPond on Windows
**********************************************************

   This document is a supplement to INSTALL.txt, you may want to read
that too.

Obtaining LilyPond
==================

   You can get the latest version of LilyPond at
ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/
(ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/).

Windows build requirements
==========================

   You need the following packages to compile Lilypond on Windows.

`The GNU + Cygnus tools, 1.1.7 or newer.'
     Check out the Cygwin webpage (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin).

`GUILE 1.4, or newer.'
     Check out the GUILE webpage
     (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile.html)

   You can get the latest version of the GNU + Cygnus tools from cygnus
mirror site (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html).

Windows precompiled binaries
============================

`LilyPond'
     Click here
     (http://appel.lilypond.org/lilypond/gnu-windows/setup.exe) to
     install LilyPond, or visit LilyPond on Windows
     (http://appel.lilypond.org/lilypond/gnu-windows).

     This will install the minimal set of cygwin tools needed to run
     LilyPond.  If you already have cygwin installed, don't worry:
     nothing will be installed twice.

   Note that none of the developers uses Windows, of course.  In fact,
we recommend you to use GNU/Linux for running LilyPond.  We provide
these binaries anyway, because it saves us the trouble of helping
Windows users trying to compile LilyPond themselves.

   These binaries are cross compiled for Windows on a GNU/Linux box.
You may want to check out the cross compilation scripts
(http://appel.lilypond.org/lilypond/gnu-windows/cross.tar.gz).

Windows running requirements
============================

   GNU LilyPond does use a lot of resources. For operation you need the
following software

`GUILE'
     Included in binary installation.

`TeX'
     A full TeX installation.  See /usr/share/doc/tetex-beta for
     details.

`GSView'
     Click  here (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe) to
     install GSView (GhostView for Windows), or visit ftp.cs.wisc.edu
     (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum).

`Python'
     Click here (http://www.python.org/ftp/python/win32/py152.exe) to
     install Python-1.5.2, or visit www.python.org
     (http://www.python.org).

Windows running setup
=====================

   If you're lucky, after running `setup.exe' you're all set up.

   Open a LilyPond shell (or any bash shell), and type
     lilypond --help

   If you don't see something similar to
     Usage: lilypond [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     
     Typeset music and or play MIDI from FILE
     
     LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful sheet music
     using a high level description file as input.  LilyPond is part of
     the GNU Project.
     
     Options:
       -h,--help             this help
     [..]

   you should try adding `/usr/lilypond-x.y.z/bin' to your path, do:
     PATH=/usr/lilypond-1.3.147/bin:$PATH

   and try again.
