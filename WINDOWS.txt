WINDOWS - compiling and installing GNU LilyPond on Windows
**********************************************************

   This document is a supplement to INSTALL.txt, you may want to read
that too.

Obtaining LilyPond
==================

   You can get the latest version of LilyPond at
ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/
(ftp://ftp.cs.uu.nl/pub/GNU/LilyPond/).

Windows build requirements
==========================

   You need the following packages to compile Lilypond on Windows.

`The GNU + Cygnus tools, 1.1.7 or newer.'
     Check out the Cygwin webpage (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin).
     You can get the latest version of the GNU + Cygnus tools from
     cygnus mirror site (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html).
     Install everything, including tetex.

`GUILE 1.4, or newer.'
     Check out the GUILE webpage
     (http://www.gnu.org/software/guile.html).  You may need the patch
     `guile-1.4-gnu-windows.patch' included in LilyPond's source
     distribution.

Windows precompiled binaries
============================

`LilyPond'
     Click here
     (http://appel.lilypond.org/lilypond/gnu-windows/setup.exe) to
     install LilyPond, or visit LilyPond on Windows
     (http://appel.lilypond.org/lilypond/gnu-windows).

     This will install the minimal set of cygwin tools needed to run
     LilyPond.  If you already have cygwin installed, don't worry:
     nothing will be installed twice.  To expand on this minimal set,
     click here (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/setup.exe), or visit
     a Cygwin mirror site
     (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html).

   Note that none of the developers uses Windows, of course.  In fact,
we recommend you to use GNU/Linux for running LilyPond.  We provide
these binaries anyway, because it saves us the trouble of helping
Windows users trying to compile LilyPond themselves.

   These binaries are cross compiled for Windows on a GNU/Linux box.
You may want to check out the cross compilation scripts
(http://appel.lilypond.org/lilypond/gnu-windows/cross-1.1.8.tar.gz).

Windows running requirements
============================

   GNU LilyPond does use a lot of resources. For operation you need the
following software

`GUILE'
     Included in binary installation.

`TeX'
     A full TeX installation.  Click here
     (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/miktex/miktex-2.0-lvl-1.zip)
     to install basic MiKTeX commands, or visit www.miktex.org
     (http://www.miktex.org).

`PostScript tools'

    `GSView-2.6, or'
          This old package has two advantages.  It has gsview and
          ghostscript bundeled, and it doesn't popup _Register
          Now|Cancel_ windows all the time.  It doesn't work together
          with Yap to display PostScript specials.

          Click here
          (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv26w32.exe) to
          install GSView-2.6 (GhostView for Windows), or visit
          ftp.cs.wisc.edu (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum).

    `GSView-3.6 and GhostScript-6.50'
          If you install both these packages, Yap will display
          PostScript specials.  You get annoying _Register Now|Cancel_
          popups, though.

          Click here
          (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum/gsv36w32.exe) for
          GSview and Click here
          (ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/AFPL/gs650/gs650w32.exe)
          for GhostScript.  ftp.cs.wisc.edu
          (ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/ghostgum).  or visit the
          Ghostview and GSview site.

`Python'
     Click here (http://www.python.org/ftp/python/win32/py152.exe) to
     install Python-1.5.2, or visit www.python.org
     (http://www.python.org).

     Python > 1.5.2 has ugly licensing issues, so we only used and
     tested 1.5.2.

Windows running setup
=====================

   If you're lucky, after running `setup.exe' you're all set up.

   Open a LilyPond shell (or any bash shell), and type
     lilypond --help

   If you don't see something similar to
     Usage: lilypond [OPTION]... [FILE]...
     
     Typeset music and or play MIDI from FILE
     
     LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful sheet music
     using a high level description file as input.  LilyPond is part of
     the GNU Project.
     
     Options:
       -h,--help             this help
     [..]

   you should try adding `/usr/lilypond-x.y.z/bin' to your PATH, do:
     PATH=/usr/lilypond-1.3.147/bin:$PATH

   and try again.

   [TODO:

   * politely ask windows users not to complain but rather send
instructive bug reports along with patches.

   * emacs-mode installation, figure out and describe proper
emacs-on-cygwin setup.

   * talk about /etc/profile.d/lilypond-profile.sh

   * GUILE errors, simple guile test

   * (La)TEX errors, simple tex test
