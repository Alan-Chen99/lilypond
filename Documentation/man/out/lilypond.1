\fBlilypond\fP [OPTION]\&.\&.\&. [MUDELA-FILE]\&.\&.\&.
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
LilyPond is the GNU Project music typesetter\&.  This program can print
beautiful sheet music from a music definition file\&.  It can also play
mechanical performances to a MIDI file\&.  Features include multiple
staffs, meters, clefs, keys, lyrics, versatile input language, cadenzas,
beams, slurs, triplets, formatting scores, part extraction\&.  It includes
a nice font of musical symbols\&.
.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.IP "-I,--include=FILE" 
add \fBFILE\fP to the search path for input files\&.
.IP "-M,--midi" 
This disables TeX output\&. If you have a \emidi definition, it will do the 
midi output only\&.
.IP "-d,--dependencies" 
Also output rules to be included in Makefile\&.
.IP "-D,--debug" 
Turn debugging info on\&.  GNU LilyPond reads the file \fB\&.dstreamrc\fP, 
which lists what functions and classes may produce copious debugging
output\&.
.IP "-s,--safe" 
Disallow untrusted \f(CW\einclude\fP directives, backslashes in 
code and named output\&.
.IP "-t,--test" 
Switch on any experimental features\&.  Not for general public use\&.
.IP "-w,--warranty" 
Show the warranty with which GNU LilyPond comes\&. (It comes with 
\fBNO WARRANTY\fP!)
.IP "-o,--output=FILE" 
Set the default output file to \fBFILE\fP\&.
.IP "-h,--help" 
Show a summary of usage\&.
.IP "-i,--init=FILE" 
Set init file to \fBFILE\fP (default: \fBinit\&.ly\fP)\&.
.IP "--include, -I=DIRECTORY" 
Add \fBDIRECTORY\fP to the search path for input files\&.
.IP "--ignore-version, -V" 
Make incompatible mudela version non-fatal\&.
.IP "--find-fourths, -Q" 
Warn about melodic intervals larger than a fourth\&.  Useful for 
converting absolute octave mode stuff to relative octaves\&.
.PP 
.SH "FEATURES" 
.PP 
This is an overview of the features that GNU LilyPond supports\&.  For
details on how to use them, you should consult the Mudela tutorial,
which is included with the package\&.
.PP 
.IP o 
ASCII script input, with identifiers (for music reuse),
customizable notenames, customisable fontset\&.
.IP o 
MIDI output lets you check if you have entered the correct notes\&.
.IP o 
MIDI to Mudela conversion through the mi2mu program\&.
.IP o 
Multiple staffs in one score\&.  Each staff can have different meters\&.
.IP o 
Beams, slurs, ties, chords, super/subscripts (accents and text)
triplets, general n-plet (triplet, quadruplets, etc\&.), lyrics,
transposition dynamics (both absolute and hairpin style)\&.
.IP o 
Multiple voices within one staff; beams optionally shared
between voices\&.  Up to four voices is handled cleanly\&.
.IP o 
Multiple scores within one input file\&.  Each score is output to
a different file\&.
.IP o 
Clef changes, meter changes, cadenza-mode, key changes, repeat bars\&.

.SH "HISTORY" 
.PP 
(for a  detailed changelog, see \fBNEWS\fP)
.PP 
GNU LilyPond\'s roots lie in MPP, a preprocessor to the rather arcane
MusiXTeX macro package for TeX\&.  A friend of mine, Jan Nieuwenhuizen
wrote the first 44 versions (0\&.01 to 0\&.44), then his program caught my
attention, and I was slowly sucked in to the interesting problem of
easily producing beautifully printed music\&.  I contributed some
code\&.  We soon realised that MPP\'s design was too fundamentally broken
to be repaired, so it was decided to rewrite MPP\&.  We debated a lot about
the requirements to an inputformat (fall 1995)\&.  I sat down and started
with a parser-first, bottom-up rewrite called mpp95 (which totally
failed, obviously)\&.
.PP 
After long and hard thinking, I came up with an algorithm for the
horizontal spacing of multiple staffs (april 1996) I coded it (and did
not test it)\&.  After starting with this fundamental piece, I slowly
added the stages which come before spacing, and after\&.  A half year
later, I had a first working version, (october 1996)\&.  I announced
Patchlevel 0\&.0\&.7 (or 8) to the mutex list after asking some technical
details on spacing; it was downloaded approximately 4 times\&.  Then I
got the hang of it, and in the subsequent two months, I coded until it
had doubled in size (pl 23)\&.
.PP 
Most the other history is described in the NEWS file\&.  The first large
scale release (0\&.1) was done after approximately 78 patchlevels on
August 1, 1997\&.
