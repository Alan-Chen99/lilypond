HINTS

* add new items at the top

* only show verbatim input for syntax/input changes

* try to be as brief possible in those cases

* don't try to provide real-world examples, they often get too big,
which scares away people.

* Write complete sentences.

* only show user-visible changes.

@end ignore

@item
Funk-style and Walker-style shape notes have been added.

@item
Rests will no longer keep a staff alive if @code{\RemoveEmptyStaffContext}
is used.

@item
New option @code{-dinclude-settings=INCLUDEFILE.ly}, which causes lilypond
to include the given file before the score is processed. This allows the
user to change global settings without the need to change the score itself.
That way, several different editions/version (e.g. different page sizes)
can be generated from a file without having to modify the score for each
version.

@item
The autobeaming settings syntax has been changed.  beatLength,
beatGrouping, beamSettings, and measureGrouping have all been eliminated.
Autobeaming is now controlled by baseMoment, beatStructure, and
beamExceptions.  Default settings for each of these properties can be
stored for any time signature in time-signature-settings, so that
when the time signature is changed, the autobeaming will automatically
change.  The new syntax should be much easier and require fewer
overrides.

@item
The SVG backend has optional support for
@uref{http://www.w3.org/Submission/WOFF, WOFF fonts}.  Using the Scheme
option @code{-d svg-woff} together with the SVG backend selection
@code{-d backend=svg}, produces SVG output with CSS WOFF font selection.

@item
The LilyPond G clef has been rotated 1.5 degrees clockwise for improved
balance.  The old and new versions can be compared by looking at the
documentation:
@uref{http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond/The-Feta-font.html#Clef-glyphs,
old version},
@uref{http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.13/Documentation/notation/the-feta-font.html#Clef-glyphs,
new version}.


@item
Text crescendo spanners can now be added directly using @code{\cresc},
@code{\dim} and @code{\decresc}.
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
c4\cresc c c c\f |
c4\dim c c c\!
@end lilypond


@item
The documented syntax of @samp{lilypond} environments in the @LaTeX{}
mode of @command{lilypond-book} has been changed to conform with
standard @LaTeX{} syntax: options now come after the environment name:
@example
\begin@{lilypond@}[@var{options}] @dots{}
@end example

The previous syntax with options after @samp{\begin} is still accepted
by @command{lilypond-book} but deprecated.  Something like
@example
sed -i '/begin\[/s/begin\(\[[^]]*]\)\(@{lilypond@}\)/begin\2\1/'
@end example

might do the trick for conversion.

@item
Aesthetics of shape note heads have been enhanced.  Variable line thicknesses
have been implemented.  All note widths have been made consistent.
Minor shape note commands that use the relative major key for scale steps
have been added.

@item
A variant of the segno sign is provided:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
c4 d e f \bar "S"
g4 f e d
@end lilypond

@item
Context modifications (@code{\with} blocks) can be stored in variables and
inserted into contexts or other @code{\with} blocks:
@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
coloredheads = \with { \override NoteHead #'color = #red }
noclef = \with { \remove "Clef_engraver" }
\score {
  \new Staff {
    \new Voice \with { \coloredheads } \relative c' { c4 e g c }
  }
  \layout {
    \context {
      \Staff
      \noclef
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

@item
A half-open articulation was added:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
c4\halfopen
@end lilypond
This is sometimes used to indicate half-open hi-hats.

@item
The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm is now fully supported for
single-line markup due to enhanced integration with Pango.

@item
LilyPond is now licensed under the GNU GPL v3+.

@item
In tablature, frets can be indicated with labels other than numbers:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
\new TabStaff
\with {
  stringTunings = #'(17 14 9 5 2 -3)
  tablatureFormat = #fret-letter-tablature-format
}
\new TabVoice {
  \set fretLabels = #`(,(markup #:with-color red "a")
                       "b"
                       ,(markup #:italic #:smaller "c"))
  <f d>4. <bes>8 <g e>4
}
@end lilypond

@item
Layout objects can be printed over a white background, which whites-out objects
in lower layers which lie beneath:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=1]
\time 3/4
\override Staff.StaffSymbol #'layer = #4
\once \override Tie #'layer = #2
b'2.~
\once \override Staff.TimeSignature #'whiteout = ##t
\once \override Staff.TimeSignature #'layer = #3
\time 5/4
b4
@end lilypond

@item
Chords can be repeated using the @code{q} shortcut:

@lilypond[verbatim,quote,relative=2]
<c e g>8.-^ q16 q4-^
@end lilypond

@item
With two-sided mode, margins for odd and even pages can be set using
@code{inner-margin} and @code{outer-margin}:

@example
\paper @{
  two-sided = ##t
  inner-margin = 10 \mm
  outer-margin = 20 \mm
@}
@end example

@item
Paper margin defaults, as specified in @file{ly/@/paper@/-defaults@/-init@/.ly}, apply
to the default paper size (a4) and are automatically scaled according to the
paper size chosen.

@item
All combinations of @code{left-margin}, @code{right-margin} and
@code{line-width} work now.  There is no more need to set @code{line-width}
manually unless you explicitly want to.

@item
Support for using an alternative music font, such as Gonville, is now
added.

@item
In addition to the existing @code{\hspace} markup command,
a new @code{\vspace} command has been added to provide an easy
and flexible way to add vertical space in markups.

@item
The direction of manual beams can be set with @code{^[} and @code{_[}.

@item
A version of the breve note head has been added with two vertical lines on each side.
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
\time 4/2
\override Staff.NoteHead #'style = #'altdefault
c\breve | b\breve
@end lilypond

@item
Instrument names and vocal names now take into account the extent of
system start delimiters in other staves for their positioning,
resulting in improved default alignment for left-, center- and
right-aligned names.
@lilypond[quote,indent=18\mm]
<<
  \new StaffGroup <<
    \new GrandStaff <<
      \new Staff {
        \set Staff.instrumentName = #"Piccolo"
        c''1
      }
      \new Staff {
        \set Staff.instrumentName = #"Flute"
        c''1
      }
    >>
    \new Staff {
      \set Staff.instrumentName = #"Bassoon"
      \clef tenor
      c'1
    }
  >>
  \new PianoStaff <<
    \set PianoStaff.instrumentName = #"Piano"
    \context Staff = "up" {
      c'1
    }
    \context Staff = "down" {
      \clef bass
      c1
    }
  >>
>>
@end lilypond

@item
Braces in markup can now be selected by point size using the markup commands
@code{\left-brace} and @code{\right-brace}.
@lilypond[quote]
\markup {
  \left-brace #35
  \hspace #2
  \right-brace #45
}
@end lilypond

@item
Intermediate .ps files which are created by LilyPond
during compilation are now deleted by default.  To keep them,
add the following line to your input files:
@example
#(ly:set-option 'delete-intermediate-files #f)
@end example

@item
Dashed and dotted slurs, phrasing slurs, and ties
have been made variable thickness, and
partially dashed slurs are now available:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
\slurDashed
c4( d e f) |
\slurDotted
g4( f e d) |
\slurHalfDashed
c4( d e f)
@end lilypond

@item
An eyeglasses markup was added, indicating strongly to look at the
conductor for instructions:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
\mark \markup { \eyeglasses }
c4_\markup { \eyeglasses }
@end lilypond

@item
A snap-pizzicato (also known as Bartok-pizzicato) articulation was added:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
c4\snappizzicato
@end lilypond

@item
Tuplet number formatting functions are now available to print other fractions
and to add notes to the number or fraction:
@lilypond[quote,relative=2]
\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-denominator-text 7)
\times 2/3 { c4. c4. c4. c4. }

\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-fraction-text 12 7)
\times 2/3 { c4. c4. c4. c4. }
\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::append-note-wrapper
    (tuplet-number::non-default-tuplet-fraction-text 12 7) "8")
\times 2/3 { c4. c4. c4. c4. }

\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::append-note-wrapper tuplet-number::calc-denominator-text "4")
\times 2/3 { c8 c8 c8 c8 c8 c8 }
\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::append-note-wrapper tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text "4")
\times 2/3 { c8 c8 c8 c8 c8 c8 }

\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::fraction-with-notes "4." "8")
\times 2/3 { c4. c4. c4. c4. }
\once \override TupletNumber #'text =
  #(tuplet-number::non-default-fraction-with-notes 12 "8" 4 "4")
\times 2/3  { c4. c4. c4. c4. }
@end lilypond

@item
FretBoards now have a chordChanges property to keep repeated FretBoard objects
from being typeset.
