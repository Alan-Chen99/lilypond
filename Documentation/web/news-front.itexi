@subsubheading LilyPond 2.13.36 released!  @emph{Oct 19, 2010}

We are happy to announce the release of LilyPond 2.13.36.  This
release contains the usual number of bugfixes.  However, a number
of critical issues still remain, so this release is intended for
developers only.

Please note that this is @strong{not} the third alpha test.  Due
to a number of untested changes to our build process, we cannot be
at all confident about the quality of this release.
