@section Build system overview

Build system is currently GNU make, with an extra "stepmake" layer
on top.  Look at files in @file{make/} and @file{stepmake/} and
all @file{GNUmakefile}s.

There is wide-spread dissatisfaction with this system, and we are
considering changing.  This would be a huge undertaking (estimated
200+ hours).  This change will probably involve not using GNU make
any more -- but a discussion about the precise build system will
have to wait.  Before we reach that point, we need to figure out
(at least approximately) what the current build system does.

Fundamentally, a build system does two things:

@enumerate
@item
Constructs command-line commands, for example:

@example
lilypond-book \
  --tons --of --options \
  pitches.itely
texi2pdf \
  --more --imperial --and --metric --tons --of --options \
  pitches.texi
@end example

@item
If there was a previous build, it decides which parts of the
system need to be rebuilt.

@end enumerate

When I try to do anything in the build system, it helps to remind
myself of this.  The "end result" is just a series of command-line
commands.  All the black magick is just an attempt to construct
those commands.
