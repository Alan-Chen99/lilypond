The function of @code{@bs{}autoBeamOff} when used with
@code{@bs{}partcombine} can be difficult to understand.  It may
be preferable to use

@example
\set Staff.autobeaming = ##f
@end example

@noindent
instead, to ensure that autobeaming will be turned off for the entire
staff.

@code{\partcombine} apparently works with 3 voices -- stem up single,
stem down single, stem up combined.

An @code{\autoBeamOff} call in the first argument to partcombine will
apply to the voice that is active at the time the call is processed,
either stem up single or stem up combined.
An @code{\autoBeamOff} call in the second argument will apply to the
voice that is stem down single.

In order to use @code{\autoBeamOff} to stop all autobeaming when used
with @code{\partcombine},
it will be necessary to use @emph{three} calls to @code{\autoBeamOff}.
