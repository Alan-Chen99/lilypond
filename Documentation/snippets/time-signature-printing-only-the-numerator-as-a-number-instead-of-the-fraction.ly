Sometimes, a time signature should not print the whole fraction (for
example, 7/4), but only the numerator (digit@tie{}7 in this case). This
can be easily done by using
@code{\\override Staff.TimeSignature.style = #'single-number} to change
the style permanently. By using
@code{\\revert Staff.TimeSignature.style}, this setting can be
reversed. To apply the single-number style to only one time signature,
use the @code{\\override} command and prefix it with a @code{\\once}.
