% `neumeDemoLayout` defines a layout block suitable for notating pure
% Vaticana style neumes without any other notation symbols such as
% staff lines or clefs.  This layout is useful for engraving neumes
% tables, such as that one in the LilyPond manual section on
% Gregorian ligatures, or for educational works.
