This directory is mainly for large examples that are included in the manual.
Most of these examples are distinct snippets; files that are also included
in the regression tests should be copied from `input/regression/` into this
direction and listed here.

- Anything from the LSR should be in `Documentation/snippets/`, though.

- `simple.ly` isn't large, but it is included from
  `scm/define-markup-commands.scm` and should not be removed.

Do not use `@ref{}` in files in `Documentation/en/included/`; instead, cross
references should be made with specific macros such as `@rcontrib{}`,
`@rextend{}`, etc.  See `Documentation/en/macros.itexi` (and
`Documentation/en/common-macros.itexi`) for a complete list.
